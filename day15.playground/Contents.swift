// MARK: Access control
// Don't need to specify this most of the time, but:
// Public: this means everyone can read and write the property.
// Internal: this means only your Swift code can read and write the property. If you ship your code as a framework for others to use, they wonâ€™t be able to read the property.
// File Private: this means that only Swift code in the same file as the type can read and write the property.
// Private: this is the most restrictive option, and means the property is available only inside methods that belong to the type, or its extensions.

// MARK: Polymorphism and typecasting
// Because of inheritance, a class can be a superset of another class - and can therefore be treated as both classes.

// Captures its env. See `vw` above.
